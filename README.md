# A-Smart-Village
This is my final project for Computer Graphice Course in 9 semester (27 may, 2025).
In this project , I create a village which has hills, houses, threes , sky, sun, clouds and windmill.
I add translation and rotation. As a result it create a motion in the image.
There the clouds move and the windmill start moving when the clouds move.
Also the sun rise from east and sunset at the west side.
