# A smart village

This is my final project for Computer Graphics Course in 9 semester, 27 May, 2025.


## Features

- There is a beautiful blue sky.
- Three Hills cover with snow
- There are 3 beautiful houses
- Some Wind Mill that rotate when the wind start
- Some clouds in snow white color. They translate from one side to another
- Also a yellow Sun that rise from east and sunset at the west side
- In this graphics project, I add both Translation and Rotation to create an Animation effect.


###  Enjoy the animation
